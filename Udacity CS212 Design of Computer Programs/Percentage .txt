I learned with deepness about the interaction of graphs with the complexity of an algorithm, and how use data structures 
that represent those graphs are the key on optimizing the time that it takes for a program to go through iterations in 
order to solve a designated problem. Plus the relevance of Big notation when it's time to calculate and implement an 
efficient algorithm.
